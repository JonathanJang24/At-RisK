# At-RisK
At RisK? is a program designed to help families and individuals identify and assess the risk level that they are at from Sexual Offenders.
Based on the User's Address, Sex, and Age, it determines if the individual is more at risk compared to nearby offender's previous offenses.
It uses a publically available database and public information to compute calculations and assessments.




***The program currently only has information on Texas Offenders***
